      <h2>Bringing Behavioral Health Into Primary Care</h2>
      <div class="about-body">
        <p>
          I'm a clinical psychologist and the Director of Integrated Behavioral Health in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. In that role, I oversee clinical services, trainee education, and strategic development for UVA's Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) program across multiple clinic sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work sits at the intersection of clinical care, health systems, and implementation science. I'm interested in how primary care practices build behavioral health programs that are sustainable, evidence-based, and actually work in the reality of busy clinical environments — not just in ideal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work externally with health systems and primary care organizations on behavioral health integration strategy, model selection, and program development. I write about these topics because most of what gets published about integrated behavioral health is either too abstract to be actionable or too narrow to generalize. There's a gap between the evidence base and what practitioners actually need to build good programs.
