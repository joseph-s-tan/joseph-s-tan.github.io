            <h2>Bringing Behavioral Health Into Primary Care</h2>
            <p>I'm a clinical psychologist working at the intersection of clinical care, health systems, and implementation science.</p>
          </header>
          <p>I serve as Director of Integrated Behavioral Health in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, where I oversee clinical services, trainee education, and strategic development for UVA's Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) program across multiple clinic sites.</p>
          <p>My interest is in how primary care practices build behavioral health programs that are sustainable, evidence-based, and actually work in the reality of busy clinical environments — not just in ideal conditions. I also work externally with health systems and primary care organizations on behavioral health integration strategy, model selection, and program development.</p>
          <p>I write about these topics because most of what gets published about integrated behavioral health is either too abstract to be actionable or too narrow to generalize. There's a gap between the evidence base and what practitioners actually need to build good programs.</p>
