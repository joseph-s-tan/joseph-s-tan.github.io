      <h2>Bringing Behavioral Health Into Primary Care</h2>
      <div class="about-body">
        <p>
          I'm a clinical psychologist and the Director of Integrated Behavioral Health in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. In that role, I oversee clinical services, trainee education, and strategic development for UVA's Primary Care Behavioral Health (PCBH) program across multiple clinic sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work sits at the intersection of clinical care, health systems, and implementation science. I help primary care practices build behavioral health programs that are sustainable, evidence-based, and actually work in the reality of busy clinical environments — not just in ideal conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of UVA, I consult with health systems and primary care organizations on behavioral health integration strategy, model selection, and program implementation. I bring a practitioner's perspective to implementation work: I've built these programs from the inside, supervised the clinicians who staff them, and navigated the operational and cultural challenges that don't show up in the literature.
