        <p>Stress is an experience we all run into in our lives. We might experience it related to the pressures of work or school, as we navigate seasons of change in our lives, or while we balance competing demands for our time.</p>

        <p>Typically when most people think about "stress management," they start with ways to reduce or avoid the stress-causing factors. But what if stress itself is the signal? What if it's our internal GPS alerting us that we've drifted from what truly matters?</p>

        <p>Clarifying our values and taking action to align with them can serve as a compass that helps us navigate the stormy seas of stress.</p>

        <h2>The Stress-Values Connection</h2>

        <p>Stress isn't just about doing too much — it can also be worsened when we are unclear about the "why" of what we do. When our daily actions misalign with our core values, we experience a chronic stress that can build into a problem, even if it seems low-grade at first. If we can't articulate our values, we have difficulty prioritizing and saying "no," leading us to run into more stressors than we need to.</p>

        <p>Stress awareness, then, isn't just about identifying your stressors; it's about spotting where your daily life has drifted from your internal compass.</p>

        <h2>The Bullseye Exercise: A Practical Tool</h2>

        <p>Our best tool for identifying these values misalignments is an exercise called the <strong>Bullseye</strong>. The Bullseye is a way of visualizing our values alignment across different life domains. This exercise comes from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based treatment approach that we commonly use in our Primary Care Behavioral Health service at UVA Family Medicine.</p>

        <p>The Bullseye covers four life domains:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Work/Education</strong> — pursuing meaningful projects, contributing to a field you care about</li>
          <li><strong>Relationships</strong> — being fully present with loved ones, building trust</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Growth/Health</strong> — honoring your body's needs, developing skills that matter to you</li>
          <li><strong>Leisure/Recreation</strong> — protecting time for joy, creative expression</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The exercise involves two steps.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Values</h3>

        <p>For each life domain, identify what matters to you — what kind of person you want to be, or what personal qualities you want to show. If you get stuck, a helpful prompt is: <em>"What would I want someone to say about me at my retirement party?"</em></p>

        <p>Sometimes people confuse values and goals. Goals are tangible accomplishments that can be achieved; values are broader life directions we move toward. Think of values as cardinal directions, and goals as the specific destinations on a map.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Rate Your Current Alignment</h3>

        <p>The second step is to rate your current alignment with each value on the Bullseye. The closer to the center, the more aligned you are; being further out shows less alignment. This gives you an immediate visual reference for the gaps between your values and your current behavior.</p>

        <h2>From Awareness to Action</h2>

        <p>Once you try the Bullseye, you'll likely notice gaps in multiple domains. <strong>Resist the urge to fix everything at once</strong> — that path leads to more overwhelm, not less.</p>

        <p>Pick one domain where your mark is far from center. Then think of <strong>one</strong> small action you can take in the next week that would move your mark closer in. For example, to take action on a leisure value of "flexing my creative muscle more often," a first step might be as simple as "visiting the library to learn about class offerings." That by itself might not move the mark all the way to center, but it is a step in the right direction.</p>

        <p>Small, consistent actions that build alignment are better than attempts at dramatic overhaul. Consistent action builds self-efficacy and creates a positive feedback loop that makes future values-aligning actions even more likely.</p>

        <h2>The Role of Primary Care Behavioral Health</h2>

        <p>This approach to values clarification is a key strategy we use in our Primary Care Behavioral Health service at UVA Family Medicine. We embed clinicians with behavioral health expertise — behavioral health consultants — directly in the primary care clinic, because stress often shows up as physical symptoms first: headaches, sleep disruption, digestive issues. Our integrated model helps catch values misalignment before it becomes a health crisis.</p>

        <p>Primary care's focus on continuity in care relationships means we see patients during important life transitions. Embedding within the primary care team reduces the stigma barrier that can interfere with referring to external behavioral health providers. And collaborating with medical providers helps us make connections between patients' physical symptoms and their stress.</p>

        <h2>Try It Today</h2>

        <p>While we can't avoid experiencing stress at some point in our lives, values provide a crucial source of navigation when we are stressed.

        <p>After all, stress awareness isn't just about spotting problems — it's about protecting what matters most.</p>
